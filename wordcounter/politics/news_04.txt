Photos Show Kavanaugh in a Suit, but Blasey in Sunglasses. Why?
A reader points out that news photographs show Judge Brett Kavanaugh in suits, while his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, looks much more casual, with “wind in her hair.” Our photo editor responds.

A reader emailed The Times on Tuesday asking about our selection of photographs for President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, and the woman who has accused him of sexually assaulting her in high school, Christine Blasey Ford.

“Why in this highly charged political atmosphere of TV and print news are we always seeing pictures of Brett Kavanaugh in a business suit looking sober and professional, and those of Dr. Blasey in informal clothing, sunglass wearing, wind in her hair, smiling as if for a travel brochure?” wrote Myrna Simms, from Tucson.

“Equal representation? I think not.”

We asked our photo editor in Washington, Marisa Schwartz Taylor, to respond:

“We have tried several times to get more photos of Dr. Blasey (offering to have one of our photographers shoot a portrait of her and also asking if she could send us better photos of herself to publish), but she and her lawyers have declined all of our photo requests.

“Judge Kavanaugh, on the other hand, has been photographed in public during his confirmation hearings and on visits to Capitol Hill by New York Times photographers.


“We are very much looking forward to having new photos of Dr. Blasey to publish once the hearing starts on Thursday to provide a more accurate depiction of her.”
